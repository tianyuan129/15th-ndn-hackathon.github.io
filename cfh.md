title: Call for Hacks
---
We solicit hackathon project proposals that advance the state of NDN. Participants will have approximately **two days** to work on their projects.


We encourage projects that:

- directly address the NDN project's research needs,
- create new NDN tools or improve existing tools, or
- create or improve documentation and how-to guides.

If you have a project in mind, please follow the submission instructions below.

#### **Limited Remote participation!**

We will post video conference links before the hackathon.
With these, remote participants will be able to:

- watch project pitches,
- pitch their own project(s), and
- present their project at the conclusion of the hackathon.

We will also create a Slack channel for communication during the hackathon.

## Submission instructions

Proposals should be submitted via the [web form](https://forms.gle/Eh6gw8fPaiV8ACXT8).
You also need to register for the hackathon [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/736029894227?aff=oddtdtcreator).

Submissions should include:

- No more than 3 slides in PDF format, listing the project leader(s) and summarizing the problem, contributions, tasks, required knowledge, and expected outcomes of the project.

All submitted proposals will be reviewed by the Organizing Committee before the hackathon.
If accepted, the project leader is expected to give a one minute “pitch” presentation at the start of the Hackathon, soliciting participation from other attendees.

At the conclusion of the hackathon, projects will be judged by a separate panel for one or more prizes.
We hope that the hackathon will be a fun event for all and that projects will lead to collaborations that extend beyond the duration of the hackathon.

## Additional information

### How open-ended should proposals be?

Ideally, project proposals should include room for discussion and cooperative design during the hackathon, but may be entirely planned in advance (e.g. a new NFD feature).
We ask that proposals avoid larger projects that are completely open in terms of design.
Moreover, the significance and impact of the contribution is more important than its "spectacle".

### Who will work on the projects?

Hackathon projects will be developed by small teams (<8) and should be able to show measurable progress after two days.
Participants are encouraged to regroup and refresh overnight in their respective time zones.
The hackathon welcomes all interested participants, regardless of NDN experience, so we are seeking projects that are suitable for experienced NDN developers, as well as those that are approachable by newcomers.
For example, a project could be composed of tasks requiring various levels of skill or, alternatively, be specifically targeted to a specific level of skill.

### What languages, libraries, etc. are allowed?

Project proposals should declare the expected programming languages, libraries, platform requirements, and so forth.
For new projects, we ask you to consider how the specifics, such as language choice, may impact the proposal's ability to attract participants.
The hackathon organizers will provide proposal feedback and assistance to ensure projects have a concrete path to implementation.

### If I propose a project, do I have to go to the Hackathon?

Proposals must specify one or more representatives who will attend the hackathon to pitch their idea and guide its development over the duration of the hackathon (hacking optional).
Representatives will have one minute to present their idea to attendees at the start of the hackathon.
The pitch should emphasize the project's motivation, use cases, and goals.
